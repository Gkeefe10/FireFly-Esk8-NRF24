# FireFly-Esk8-NRF24
!STILL IN DEVELOPMENT, NOT ALL WORKING YET!
This is a modded Version of Solidgeek's FireFly Firmware with extra Features

Features:
- 3-quickpress-hold on trigger for Cruise Control
- total Kilometer counter (Saves all your total stats without stressing the EEPROM)
STILL TO DO
- Action Based Information Example: Power and Speed while Riding, Battery Level and Total Km while standing
- A somewhat accurate Battery Level
- Better functions for calibrating your throttle

Basically the same as Solidgeeks awesome Firmware but with some nice upgrades :)
