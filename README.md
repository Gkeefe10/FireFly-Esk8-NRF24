# FireFly-Esk8-NRF24
This is a modded Version of Solidgeek's FireFly Firmware with extra Features

It's generally the same as Solidgeeks Firmware, but with a 3-quick-press Cruise Control Activation, which is really usefull if you want
to use cruise control a lot and not give up the Deadman switch.
As well as a total Km kilometer counter, that saves all the kilometers you have ridden.
And a action/situation based information display. Instead of showing all the stats constantly in rotation I only want to show whats
really important at every given moment.
