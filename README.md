# FireFly-Esk8-NRF24

This is a modded Version of Solidgeek's FireFly Firmware with extra Features

Features:
- Action Based Information
    Example: Power and Speed while Riding, Voltage/Stats while standing
- A somewhat accurate Battery Level (where the throttle usually is)
- total Kilometer counter (Saves all your total stats without stressing the EEPROM)
    (saves everytime vesc gets turned off before the remote or every 2Km of ridden distance)
- total energy used meter (does the same as total KM counter)

STILL TO DO
- Better functions for calibrating your throttle

OPTIONAL
- 3-quickpress-hold on trigger for Cruise Control // not really needed

Basically the same as Solidgeeks awesome Firmware but with some nice upgrades :)
